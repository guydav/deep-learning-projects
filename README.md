# Guy Davidson's Deep Learning Projects

Or at least, mostly deep learning. This is mostly for the purpose of working with Google Colab, because doing proper software development and version control in a notebook is nigh-impossible. 

I imagine this will be a catch-all repository for different projects that aren't sufficiently large to reside independently yet, and that as work evolves, I will extract projects that demand independence into separate repositories. 

All work here is my own unless noted otherwise - if you wish to build on it, or have any questions, please contact me at guy [at] minerva [dot] kgi [dot] edu.
